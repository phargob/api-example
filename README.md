# botx-api

example API for https://github.com/phargob/OsrsBotx

what is here:

- old_scripts - most of my old scripts updated to at least compile, basially untested since August last year, but should probably work with minimal effort
- rsb - most of G's api intact, with some tweaks/refactors here and there
- dax - modified dax walker, stripped down and working pretty decent
- botforlife - was suppose to be an example script
